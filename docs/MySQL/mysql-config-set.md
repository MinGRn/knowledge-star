# 前言

`MySQL` 程序安装属于默认安装，其中配置文件在 `windoes` 下的文件名为：`my.ini`。

配置文件所处位置：

- **windows:** `C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server ${version}\my.ini`

# 完整配置文件

```ini
# 以下选项会被MySQL客户端应用读取。
# 注意只有MySQL附带的客户端应用程序保证可以读取这段内容。
# 如果你想你自己的MySQL应用程序获取这些值。
# 需要在MySQL客户端库初始化的时候指定这些选项。

# For advice on how to change settings please see

# Additional memory pool that is used by InnoDB to store metadata

# willing to compromise this safety, and you are running small
# transactions, you may set this to 0 or 2 to reduce disk I/O to the
# logs. Value 0 means that the log is only written to the log file and
# the log file flushed to disk approximately once per second. Value 2
# means the log is written to the log file at each commit, but the log
# file is only flushed to disk approximately once per second.
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1

# The size of the buffer InnoDB uses for buffering log data. As soon as

innodb_log_buffer_size=16M

# InnoDB, unlike MyISAM, uses a buffer pool to cache both indexes and

# access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this
# parameter up to 80% of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it
# too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may
# cause paging in the operating system.  Note that on 32bit systems you

# set it too high.
innodb_buffer_pool_size=5G

# Size of each log file in a log group. You should set the combined size
# of log files to about 25%-100% of your buffer pool size to avoid

# 修改数据库编码格式

在mysql 5.5 之前，UTF-8编码只支持1-3个字节，支持BMP这部分的Unicode编码区。

从MySQL 5.5开始，可以支持4个字节UTF编码 `utf8mb4` ，一个字符能够支持更多的字符集，也能够支持更多表情符号。

:smile: 表情为四个字节，所以在存在 emoji 的场景下需要需要使用该编码集。

utf8mb4兼容utf8，且比utf8能表示更多的字符，是utf8字符集的超集。所以现在一些新的业务，比如 ISO 等，会将 MySQL 数据库的字符集设置为 utf8mb4。

---

现在将编码集设置为 `utf8mb4`，需要修改如下配置：

```
[client]
# 服务端默认编码格式，默认为 `utf-8`
default-character-set = utf8mb4

[mysql]
# 默认字符编码，默认 `utf-8`
default-character-set = utf8mb4

[mysqld]
# 默认编码集设置，当一个任务事件或者数据表被创建是没有被指定编码集时则采用该编码集
character-set-server = utf8mb4
```

以上修改完成后重启 `mysql` 服务，在 `MySQL Command Line Client` 中输入如下命令即可查看数据库编码集：

```mysql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character%';
```

输出结果如下所示：

```
+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Variable_name            | Value                                                   |

| character_set_filesystem | binary                                                  |
| character_set_results    | utf8mb4                                                 |
| character_set_server     | utf8mb4                                                 |
| character_set_system     | utf8                                                    |
| character_sets_dir       | C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\share\charsets\ |
+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

可即看到编码格式被修改为 `utf8mb4`。

现在在命令行中执行进行 emoji 数据插入：

```sql
INSERT INTO `sys_role`(`id`, `role_name`, `role_type`, `status`, `deleted`, `sort`, `create_time`, `update_time`, `description`) 
VALUES ('62eedcd2f47e11e8881d5615b7fd4e65', 'Emoji测试😀', '6888bc90f47e11e8881d5615b7fd4e65', 1, 1, 1, '2018-11-30 17:00:11', '2018-11-30 17:00:13', NULL);
```
```
mysql> select * from sys_role;
+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------+--------+---------+------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------+
| id                               | role_name       | role_type                        | status | deleted | sort | create_time         | update_time         | description |

| 62eedcd2f47e11e8881d5615b7fd4e65 | Emoji测试😀       | 6888bc90f47e11e8881d5615b7fd4e65 |      1 |       1 |    1 | 2018-11-30 17:00:11 | 2018-11-30 17:00:13 | NULL        |
+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------+--------+---------+------+---------------------+---------------------+-------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

可以看到数据被正常插入，如果编码集设置为 `utf-8` 在插入是会提示异常。
